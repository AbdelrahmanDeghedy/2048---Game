### Description
It's a clone of the famous game: 2048 for the android. I created it using HTML, SASS, Javascript.

### Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:AbdelrahmanDeghedy/2048-game
cd 2048-game
npm run 2048
```

### Usage
#### The rules of this game is simple:
1- Move the cells, and the cells with the same number will be merged, and the number in the merged cell, is the sum of both two numbers.
2- The score is the sum of numbers in all cells.
3- The game is over, when all the cells are filled, and you have no move left.

### Common Bugs
There is a little bug when you click with the mouse (or keyboard) so quickly (before the new cell is inserted). You will find some logic errors.
